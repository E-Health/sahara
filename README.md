# :open_hands: Sahara: Examiner assisted tests/data collection based on :fire: FHIR

### Work in progress.

:open_hands: Sahara is a component of the  [:fire: The FHIRForm framework ](https://github.com/E-Health/fhirform) for supporting examiner assisted and stimulus-driven data collection based on FHIR standards. Sahara consists of a backend server (spring-boot), and frontend vue.js app typically for display on tablet devices. The examiner(s) can guide and monitor the examinee(s) as they enter data, all using tablet devices. The communication between frontend devices will be secure through WebSockets.  

:open_hands: Sahara is work in progress and is not ready for use. Read more about  [:fire: The FHIRForm framework ](https://github.com/E-Health/fhirform) here.
